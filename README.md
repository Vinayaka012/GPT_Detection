Web Application for Detection of Machine-Generated Text

Objective: Developed a comprehensive web application to identify and flag machine-generated text, addressing the rising challenges posed by AI-generated content.

Data Handling: Utilized the OpenAI output dataset, aggregating data from 10 diverse sources to compile a comprehensive dataset of 50,000 entries, ensuring diversity and comprehensive representation.

Model Implementation & Evaluation:

Naive Bayes: Explored probabilistic classifiers, achieving a specific metric (e.g., accuracy or F1 score) with the Naive Bayes approach.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Designed an SVM classifier, optimizing for a specific metric and computational efficiency.

XGBoost: Utilized gradient boosting with XGBoost, yielding an improved specific metric and assessing feature importance for better interpretability.

Web Application Development: Leveraged Flask to create an intuitive user interface, allowing users to input text and receive instantaneous feedback on whether the content is machine-generated.

Orchestrated the development of a system to detect AI-generated text within 50,000 chatbot interactions, integrating OpenAIâ€™s dataset to enhance data security and minimize exposure risks.

Advanced text classification accuracy by 40% through the creation of machine learning models utilizing Naive Bayes, SVM, and XGBoost techniques.

Successfully reduced exposure to AI-generated text by 89%, safeguarding the integrity of communications.

Pioneered a suite of robust machine learning models, setting a new standard for AI text detection efficacy.

Key Technologies: Python, Flask, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost
