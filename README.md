# Web Application for Detection of Machine-Generated Text

## Objective üéØ
This project focuses on addressing the growing challenge of distinguishing between human-written and machine-generated text. The objective is to create a robust, user-friendly web application that utilizes machine learning classifiers to identify AI-generated text with high accuracy. The application was developed as part of a dissertation, exploring the GPT-2 model's text output and applying advanced classification techniques.

## Abstract üìÑ
The rapid advancements in AI and natural language generation have enabled machines to produce text that closely resembles human-authored content. This poses significant challenges in ensuring the authenticity and credibility of digital communication.

This project introduces a web application designed to differentiate between human-written and machine-generated text, with a focus on analyzing GPT-2 model outputs. A dataset comprising 50,000 entries, curated from 10 subsets of the GPT-2 output dataset, was used to train and test machine learning classifiers. Key methodologies included feature engineering techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, sentiment analysis, and addressing class imbalance with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

The system is built using Python‚Äôs Flask framework and includes visual insights such as feature importance, performance metrics, and ROC curves for effective analysis. The application not only achieves high classification accuracy but also provides a practical tool to ensure the integrity of digital content.
